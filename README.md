**Kanban (かんばん(看板)?)** (literally signboard or billboard) is a scheduling system for lean and just-in-time (JIT)
production.Kanban is a system to control the logistical chain from a production point of view, and is not an
inventory control system. Kanban was developed by Taiichi Ohno, at Toyota, to find a system to improve and maintain
a high level of production. Kanban is one method through which JIT is achieved.
